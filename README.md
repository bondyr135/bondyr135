- 👋 Hi, I’m @bondyr135, an aspiring front-end programmer.
- 👀 I’m interested in eating food, mostly, but also in math, coding, swimming, and cooking the food I eat.
- And Oxford Commas.
- 🌱 I have a bachelor's in brain and cognitive science from Ben-Gurion University (majoring in psychology and computer science), 
   yet I have a very broad knowledge in math, from The Open University.
   With all that, all of the coding I know, I learned by myself (thank you YouTube).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... food. But also open-source projects, is you need a starting fron-end guy.
- 📫 Are there DMs on GitHub?
